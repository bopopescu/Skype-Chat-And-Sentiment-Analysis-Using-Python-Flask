We had created API for mining of Skype Chat text data after that applied sentiment analysis on chat data.
All code is written in app.py file. We have created REST API with proper request validation and JWT authorization token using the python flask.

Download code from repo after that install all the required dependency/module. 
most important file is app.py all code is written in that file.
If you have't learn flask then download code from my repo hello-word-in-pyhon-flask and learn from there.
