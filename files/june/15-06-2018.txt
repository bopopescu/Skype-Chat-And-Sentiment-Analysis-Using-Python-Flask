Hi Ming,

Yes we have tried to upgrade the firmware but it wasn't happened. I am attaching screenshots of the issues been reported :



The first Image Error comes up when we downloaded the files and followed the process immediately this error came.

Hi Ming,

As Already mentioned by Mr. Nishant today we are observing a Holiday in India on account of EID FESTIVAL. There's no one in the office today. We can have the call on Monday with terminal access.

Thanks

Ok. I don’t want to lose another day as we are way behind schedule. What

terminal?
