Hi Ming,

I am about to finish the timelines and estimate revision for the 2nd milestone but I need your input on the following two items :


Customization of LED
Customization of Volume Sync

If you can explain these two then I can precisely send you the estimates and we can connect tomorrow for the same.

Thanks

Amit
These two are merely flipping the switch by calling "setSleepMode" and "setVolumeSync" api from the QCC_SNK atCmdHandler.
