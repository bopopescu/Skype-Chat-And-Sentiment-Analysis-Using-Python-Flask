Amit, the app is patched, but we need to upgrade the firmware on the bluetooth receiver. Here is the link to the upgrade package: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ixa14x5xkvojw4/dfu_snk_431_1806122243.rar?dl=0. I will walk you through upgrade process.
I won't be able to meet tomorrow morning. Can you do it now?
Hi Ming,

The earliest possible from my side can be after 2 hours from now. Let me know if you are available.

Thanks

Amit
It will be too late for me. How about 8am EST?
Let's do it tomorrow at 8.30 AM EST. Please confirm.
Amit, 8:30am is too late for me today. I can do it as early as 7:30am
Hi Ming,

Today it wont be possible as I have another meeting, So let's have it by tomorrow 8.30 AM.
Can you do it around 10:00am then?
By the time Team will not be available. I believe tomorrow will be the best time to connect.
Alright. Let's reconnect @9:00am our regular time tomorrow.
Ok Sure.. Thanks

Amit
actually. I can't do it @9 tomorrow morning either. This week morning is a bad week for me.

I will send you the procedure to do a firmware upgrade.
To upgrade the firmware in the Bluetooth receiver, follow the steps below:

1/ Unzip this file (link
https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ixa14x5xkvojw4/dfu_snk_431_1806122243.rar?dl=0)
in a temporary directory in a window PC. Go to that directory.
2/ Connect the Bluetooth receiver USB to the PC.
3/ In a cmd prompt, type: HidDfuCmd upgrade 0xA12 0xFFFE 0 0
image_signed.dfu
4/ You should get something like this:

C:\Temp>HidDfuCmd upgrade 0xA12 0xFFFE 0 0 image_signed.dfu
HidDfuCmd, version 2.6.10.1719 Release

On the app side, just do a git pull on the ionic3-sample project and rebuild.
Sorry. Forgot step 2.5 (step between 2 and 3) in the firmware upgrade procedure:
2.5/ Once the Bluetooth receiver is connected to the PC via USB, press-and-hold the button on the back for 2 sec until both LEDs are alternatively blinking. Then release the button. While both LEDs are alternatively blinking, press the button once again - this time just press-then-release. You should see the third led come up and the other two leds are off. The bluetooth receiver is now in upgrade mode.
If the Bluetooth receiver has both leds alternatively blinking right after power up, you don't need to press-and-hold 2s as you are already in pairing mode. So you just single press the button to go into the upgrade mode.
