Hi Ming, Please find attached.
Other issues:
1/ For a fresh start (i.e. after killing the app), it takes 13s from start to seeing the 1st screen. During that 13s, we saw a blank white screen.
2/ The pull-down-to-scan is not smooth on Nexus 4/7. Samsung S8 is ok.
3/ In general, seem like the UI elements positions are fixed rather than responsive to the canvas size.

Shall we meet now?
Hi Ming,

As discussed, I will be providing you the code snippet and we will discuss tomorrow in order to close Milestone #1
Yes. please provide the Discover page ts and html.
