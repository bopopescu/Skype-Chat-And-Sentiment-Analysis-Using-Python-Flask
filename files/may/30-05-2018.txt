Hi Ming,

I have received this, but we need to have have the the .gif image which you uploaded on the Invision.

Thanks

I don't have the gif. Only the html and the js. Why not just integrated the html and js into the project?
HI Ming,

Can we have it there in the 2nd milestone?

Thanks

Amit
I think my client would expect that when we show what has been achieved in the 1st milestone.
I have already tried to integrate the animation.zip files, but the files you have provided, that is from the website.

We need to the have images in order to create the the splash screen, because when we upload the splash on IONIC build it accepts only image and gif only.

Let me know if you have further queries.

Thanks

Amit
