Hi, I reviewed the implementation. My colleagues in HK are reviewing it
too.

Here are my comments so far:

1/ I expect the all the list-based screens are scrollable with bouncing
when reaching to the top and the bottom of the list. These screens are
Discover, Device List, and all Customization screens.
2/ Splash screen is not integrated. HTML5 code has already provided.
3/ All icon resolutions are low.
4/ Sync On/Off have no effect.
5/ Missing Homespot Device Actions in Discover screen. Need to discuss this.
6/ Missing Paired Device Actions in Device List.
7/ Pair new button doesn't work.
8/ Bluetooth Name has no effect.
9/ On/Off Buttons and ">" are too close to the edges.
10/ PEQ curve area should be larger (increase the height to half the screen
size).
11/ PEQ button (Pop) doesn't work.
12/ Page transitions:


The transition between Discover and LR Receiver screens is not
sliding.
The transitions inside customization sub-screens are not sliding.
Better to discuss to see overall transition effects should be
managed.

13/ Circle is too close to the edge in the volume bar - it covers the
volume bar icon.
14/ Misc problems. See screenshot A, B, and C
15/ Samsung S8 specific issues:


Just lock in portrait mode. Don't need landscape.
Alignment issue. See screenshot G.

16/ Nexus 4 specific issues:


The canvas is not optimized to the screen size. See screenshot D.
Just lock into portrait mode. Don't need landscape.
1st screen loading time from scratch is very slow - take 18s vs
similar iconic app takes 8s.

17/ Nexus 7 specific issues:


Alignment issue. See screenshot E and F.
1st screen loading time from scratch is very slow - take 15s vs
similar ionic app takes 7s.
landscape mode doesn't work.
