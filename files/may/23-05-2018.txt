Hi Ming,

Please find attached the minutes of meeting we discussed:

Attendees: Amit and Ming

Action Points :



The Images for the devices are required to be provided by Ming.



Also, the feedbacks given are more of the things related with the dynamic version of the APP.



We will be getting the screens to be ready at the background for the dynamic process.



We will be integrating the spalsh screen as provided.



Decision Made : We will work on covering maximum UI work until we are not able to work on 2nd Milestone due to device availability.

Thanks
